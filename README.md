# Traffic Sim

## Introduction
The goal of this simulation/game is to prepare learners, especially driving test candidates, for the rules of the road. By creating a realistic simulation of various laws and behavior regulations, an optimal preparation will be made possible.

## Scenario
The simulation is set in a landscape filled with roads. These roads are populated with vehicles and traffic participants that must follow all laws and behave accordingly. The simulation can be viewed from a bird's eye perspective.

## Actors
- Car
- Pedestrian
- Stop sign
- Crosswalk
- Right of way
- Intersections
- Different types of roads (e.g. one-way streets, roundabouts)
- Speedometer
- Bicycle
- Bicycle lane

## Functions
- The simulation should allow vehicles to drive in different directions and follow the appropriate signs and laws.
- Vehicles should be able to turn left and right at intersections and signal while doing so.
- Bicycles should also be implemented as part of the simulation, including a bicycle lane where bicycles can be located and properly overtaken by vehicles.
- The simulation should also include visual representations of side view, shoulder view, and turn signal view when turning.
- Cars should honk when they behave improperly, and the player should have the ability to control a vehicle in the simulation.

## Target audience
The simulation/game is aimed at learners who are eager to learn and especially at those preparing for a driving test who want to get ready for the rules of the road.

## Usage
The simulation can be run on a computer with a graphics interface. To start the simulation, follow the instructions provided in the repository.

### For Prod
1. Open the traffic simulation application in Greenfoot.
2. Click the Start button to start the simulation.
3. Observe what is happening.

To generate a new road network, press the Reset button, then click the Start button again.

### For Testing
1. Open the traffic simulation application in Greenfoot. 
2. Click the Start button to start the simulation.
3. Observe what is happening. 
#### Set Car Count
To set the number of cars on the road at one time, modify the carCount variable in the Environmet.java file on line 33.
#### Set Speed Limit Range
To change the range of speed limits that can be set, modify the class constructors on line 41 where the speed limit variable is set.
